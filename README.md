# buzzword-bazaar
Express site with MongoDB CRUD functionality. After following the [MDN Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website) to create a local library app with Express, I created this app for extra practice.  
This was an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/inventory-application).  
I found [this article](https://medium.com/@koteswar.meesala/convert-array-buffer-to-base64-string-to-display-images-in-angular-7-4c443db242cd) useful when trying to display the uploaded images which are stored as Buffers in MongoDB.
